# Theano's contribution

The Chainer team is saddened to hear about the end of Theano development. Some of us used Theano when we first started studying deep learning and many aspects of Chainer were inspired by Theano's clean interface design.

Like Theano, Chainer is a Python neural network framework with a numpy-like syntax for computation on CPUs or GPUs. Thanks to our previous work with Theano, Chainer has a [TheanoFunction](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/generated/chainer.links.TheanoFunction.html#chainer.links.TheanoFunction) which enables Theano functions to be used within Chainer as is. We have started writing a "Chainer for Theano users" article in case Theano users are interested in trying Chainer.

Our thanks again to the Theano developers for their contributions to the Deep Learning community.
