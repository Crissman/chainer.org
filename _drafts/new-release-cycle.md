From the release of v1.18.0, we will have one release per four weeks instead of the current cycle of one release per two weeks.

We have been keeping the biweekly release cycle since the first release in June, 2015.
This release cycle worked well at the initial stage of the development in which the number of features is small and the user base is not so large.
After more than one year of development, we now have a lot of features and relatively large user base, for which the current fast release cycle does not fit to several demands, including the following:

- It is hard for users to catch up with the latest update in every two weeks.
- The release management is becoming the bottleneck of the development of Chainer.
- It is becoming hard to keep the quality of each release.

Therefore, we have decided to change the release cycle.
From the release of v1.18.0, each release will be made each four weeks instead of two weeks.
Note that we may still have an accidental hot fix release at any timing to fix critical issues.
